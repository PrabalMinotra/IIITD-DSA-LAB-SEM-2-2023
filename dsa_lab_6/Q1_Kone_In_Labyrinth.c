// After successfully escaping from Egyptian mummies, Kone is called upon by Mr. Melon Tusk to explore Martian labyrinths. Kone is given with the blueprints of the largest Martian labyrinth called Oompa Loompa. The labyrinth consists of a number of rooms connected by two way tunnels. Mr Tusk wants to drive his favourite car Masla in the labyrinth and tasks Kone with making each tunnel one-way while ensuring that any room is reachable from any other room. Help Kone in this quest or report that the task is not possible.
