// You are given some starter code to create a huffman tree. Your task is to take a string as an input and answer 𝑞
//  queries. Each query contains the huffman code and you have to print the character corresponding to that code.

// Note: do not alter the code to create huffman tree, otherwise you may get different answers in case of equal frequency characters.

// Link to starter code: https://rb.gy/rgpe8

// Input
// the first line contains a string 𝑠
//  (1≤|𝑠|≤20)
//  and each 𝑠𝑖
//  is a lowercase character ('a'-'z')
// the second line contains an integer 𝑞
// , the number of queries (1≤𝑞𝑖≤26)
// the next 𝑞
//  lines contain a binary code, and you have to print the character corresponding to each code in a new line

// input
// lol
// 2
// 0
// 1

// output
// o
// l
